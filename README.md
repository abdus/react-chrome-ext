# react-chrome-ext-boilerplate

Note: if you don't like this custom setup, just generate an app using `create-react-app`

1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` to project root and run `npm i`
3. Run `npm run build`. This will generate a `build` directory.
4. When loading unpacked extension, select `build` directory

P.S.: You have to run `npm run build` everytime you change something. This can be automated by using packages like `nodemon`
